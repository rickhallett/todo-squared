Vanilla javascript implementation of a nested todo app.

**Currently being converted to Vue.js as a fullstack, universal JavaScript application**

> Project: Todo

1. Bring methods into a vue instance, intially as one object
2. Get the app functional with Vue taking care of data binding and rendering
3. Modularise
4. Incorporate the Vue routing libraries
5. Incorporate the Vue data management libraries
6. Wire up to either Express or Firebase for data persistance.
7. Add full test coverage, perhaps using todoMVC for inspiration, both unit and end-to-end testing
